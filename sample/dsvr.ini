# This can be useful to, for instance, route certain traffic over a non-VPN link (eg. Traffic that
# contains lots of information about you and you don't want associated with your VPN link. A
# good candidate for this would be traffic to Facebook, Google, etc)
# Other uses for this feature might be to route traffic over Geo-specific VPN links. This can be
# useful if you live in a region that might be geoblocked. Eg. Routing traffic to Netflix over a
# US exit node.
